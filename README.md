Factorio 3-8-3 Trains by Dogmai
- DogmaiSEA || Dogmai - South East Asia (Servers)

A collection of 3-8-3 trains that are fully filtered for basically everything I could think of, as well as "blank" stations and a unique station copier that allows you to quickly set train stations.

## The Concept

The idea behind this book is to have a collection of trains that can be copy and pasted into games ready to go.

3-8-3 trains are what I personally consider to be the gold standard after well over 1000 hours of playing Factorio, this is mainly a result of playing online on public servers where most people use a 1-4 or 1-8 train system.

In the end game, you need far more speed than what a 1-4 or 1-8 train can deliver, and so that you don't need to redo all your stations, for example if converting to 2-8-2 trains, then extending existing 1-X train stations to accomodate 3-X trains is by far the better option.

I purposely added track underneath them so that you can align them in your launch spurs.

## Blueprint Book Explanation

### Blank Station

The Blank Station is a station set to "dot signal", so you don't accidently call trains until you are ready to go.

### 16x16 TU Train Loader

Most commonly used loading size for minesites, as it is TU, anything equal to or less than 16 full blue belts will work just fine, this is also the typical size of a "standard" late game ore deposit.

Has two options, in case your train needs to go in the opposite direction.


### Blank Fluid Loader and Unloader

The Blank Fluid Loading and Unloading Station is a station set to "dot signal", so you don't accidently call trains until you are ready to go.

This fluid tank design will self-level given time, usually pretty fast, it does not need circuits.

It will be fully compatible with Factorio 2.X.


### Copier Station (Station Copier)

Paste this somewhere in your world to very quickly copy and paste "set" train stations onto pre-existing train stations.

When using ALT-Mode, this looks beautiful; fully colour coded and named to work with the trains included in this blueprint book.
